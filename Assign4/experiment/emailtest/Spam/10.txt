As a valued FINAL FANTASY XIV customer, we are grateful as always for your ongoing support and dedication.

In addition to our recent announcement on the upcoming release of FINAL FANTASY XIV Version 2.0, we also revealed our plans to start the recurring billing options.  Below are further details regarding recurring billing.

The recurring billing will be effective starting January 6th, 2012.
In order to ensure that no one is charged without prior consent, we have decided to suspend all FINAL FANTASY XIV service accounts on January 5th, 2012.
If you wish to continue playing FINAL FANTASY XIV, we ask that you renew and set up your payment method options starting December 16th, 2011.

Please click on the following link to see more detailed information on payments and restarting the recurring billing.
