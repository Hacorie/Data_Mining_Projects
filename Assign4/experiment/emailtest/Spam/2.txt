Dear InterviewStreet Participant,

At the risk of angering our userbase, we're now sending a newsletter to announce our weekly CodeSprints. You can unsubscribe here if this is not in your interest.

For the inaugural weekly CodeSprint, we're returning to our algorithmic roots with CodeSprint: Systems (US + Canada). [Please note that the region is indicative only of where the companies are located. Some of them do accept international candidates. Pocket Gems in particular] It features several small, early stage companies with a crazy amount of buzz, most notably Stripe, Socialcam, and Airtime. It'll also be a test for a number of UI improvements that we've been implementing.

CodeSprint: Systems takes place this Saturday, February 25th, and last only 4 hours. Sign up at systems.interviewstreet.com.

Thanks,
The InterviewStreet Team
