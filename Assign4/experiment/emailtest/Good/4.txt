Greetings hacorie, 

Autumn has arrived and the Headless Horseman is seeking a new Jack-O'-Lantern! Searching for a new head, he is collecting pumpkins that are exclusively carved by the great citizens of Motenia. 

We are excited to announce the first annual pumpkin carving contest! For the month of October, we will be accepting image submissions of carved pumpkins that illustrate the spirit of Halloween. 

The winner will be blessed by the Gods with an almighty Athena pet and all participants will receive a prize just for entering. 

So don't waste and act with haste for the Headless Horseman is waiting! 

Best Regards, 

- Battle of the Immortals Team
