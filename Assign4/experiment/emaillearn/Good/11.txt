Dear Nathaniel E Perry, 

	Your Federal Return Has Been Accepted!
What this means:
Congratulations! The IRS has accepted this return, and you're finished with your taxes.

Next step:
Now that your return has been accepted, in 72 hours you should be able to track your refund at Where's My Refund on the IRS Web site.

Be sure to wait 72 hours; if you check before that, you may get a message saying they don't have your information yet. If you e-filed a state return, you will receive a separate status email about that return.

How can I check the status of my federal refund?

From your computer: Wait 72 hours, then visit the IRS online tool, Where's My Refund
From your mobile device: Download MyTaxRefund by TurboTax for FREE to quickly and easily check the status of your federal and state refunds.
