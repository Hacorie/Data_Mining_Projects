You are invited to The Pioneer Summit

Monday, February 27
6:00 p.m.
Tom Jackson Building


For the first fifty years of MTSU’s existence, it had no black students.  
Zilch. Zero. 

This Pioneer Summit provides a forum for some of those first students to 
describe what it was like to be the pioneers on this campus during a period 
of racial strife and social upheaval in America, especially in the South.  

The attendees will get to hear first-hand accounts from students 
who not only enrolled but excelled.  
Confirmed panelists include transfer student Leonora Washington, 
athlete Beanie Secrest, SGA president Michael McDonald, 
athlete/Omega Psi Phi member Jimmy Powell and a representative from Kappa Alpha Psi.  

This event is free and open to the public. 
A reception will follow the forum.
