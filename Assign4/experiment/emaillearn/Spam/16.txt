It has come to our attention that you are trying to sell/trade your personal World of Warcraft account. This conflicts with the EULA and Terms of Agreement. If this proves to be true, your account will be disabled. It will be ongoing for further investigation by Blizzard employees. Thank you for your understanding in this matter.

We recommend that you should verify your account ownership immediately.

If you ignore this mail your account will be closed permanently. Once we verify your account, we will mail you that we have dropped the investigation.

Account security is solely the responsibility of the account holder. Please be advised that in the event of a compromised account, Blizzard representatives will typically lock the account. In these cases the Account Administration team will require faxed receipt of ID materials before releasing the account for play.
