Friend --

As you may have noticed, we've asked you for a donation a few times now.

But according to our records, you haven't yet made an online donation to this campaign at this email address. (If our records are wrong, I apologize and thank you!)

I'm not writing to ask you for money again. I'm actually writing to ask your opinion about why you haven't given, and what you think would inspire you or other Obama supporters like you to decide to take the leap and donate.

We have two quick questions for you. Can you take a minute to answer them?

There's a good reason we're asking for your feedback: The kind of organization we all decided to be a part of only works if people like you pitch in to build it.

It's also the reason no other candidate has been able to match our level of grassroots support. This isn't the easiest way to run a campaign -- but we know it's the right way.

That's why we want to know what you're thinking.

Please take a minute to answer these two questions today:

Thanks so much,

Rufus

P.S. -- Of course, if you'd like to become one of our million-plus grassroots donors today, by all means, please make a donation of $3 or whatever you can afford.

Contributions or gifts to Obama for America are not tax deductible.
